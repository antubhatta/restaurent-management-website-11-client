## Five main Features of restaurant management website

- User Authentication and Profiles: Implement a secure user authentication system with registration and login pages. Users should have individual profiles, and the navbar should dynamically display the user's profile picture when logged in.

- Food Display and Interaction: Display all food items on the "All Food Items" page with relevant information. Implement a search functionality to allow users to search for specific food items. Enable pagination to display a limited number of food items per page and provide a smooth browsing experience.

- Detailed Food Information: Create a "Single Food Page" that shows detailed information about a selected food item. Include an "Order" button on the single food page that redirects users to the food purchase page.

-  Responsive Design: The client-side application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable shopping experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- Food Purchase and Order Management: Develop a "Food Purchase Page" where users can fill out a form to purchase a selected food item. Ensure that the form pre-fills buyer information based on the logged-in user's details. Implement a backend process to store order information in the database and display a toast/alert on successful order completion.

- Blog Page: Design and implement a blog page that answers specific questions related to web development and databases.
